# Excites - Transform Google Sheet to Dynamic Websites
Excites is an open source project aimed at simplifying development, management and deployment of dynamic websites. The term `Excites` is derived from the words `Excel` and `Websites`. As the name suggests, we do plan to manage the entire lifecycle from an excel.

## Problems solved by Excites
* **Management** :
    Building a website is simple, there are a lot of freelancers who does that, but the hard part is maintaining it. We know, interests changes over time but many organizations find it difficult to update the same on their website. We do make it simpler by using a google sheet, so that any org owners can update the contents.

* **Server / VM** :
    Setting up our own instances on Google cloud or AWS incures a higher charge. Excites needs the server only for the initial run, rest of the communication happens between the browser and google sheets. Hence it saves a lot of CPU.
